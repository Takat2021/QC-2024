Hi there!
I'm Takat. I'm interested in the computational modeling of functional materials for a variety of applications, 
including batteries for EVs, carbon capture and utilization, catalysis and photocatalysis, mining, energy storage, and nano superconducting devices for quantum computing. 
I utilize the state-of-the-art quantum simulation techniques for determining the properties of quantum materials. 
I would like to collaborate on projects that would lead to positive impacts on our life, society, and planet.
If you have any questions, please reach out to me at takat@genmat.xyz.
